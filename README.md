# Quiz Component in React

A project based on a pluralsight course where I added more functionality to upon completion.

This repo contains the code for the Pluralsight Project "Build a Quiz Component with React," located here: https://app.pluralsight.com/projects/build-a-quiz-component-with-react/

This project was generated with `create-react-app` version 1.5.2.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
